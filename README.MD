# Boom

Boom is a hack using nltk to decompose sentences into grammatical tokens, intersperse some Boomhauerisms depending on the type of word, and assemble back into a string. This is a very simple project, completed in a short amount of time, mostly as an excuse to use nltk for some grammar shenanigans and POC this kind of processing before use in a discord bot or equivalent. Works best if you have a convincing thin southern accent and you can read the output at 400 words per minute.

Please use this if you like. This code is licensed under MIT. But do let me know if you build this into a website or something, I could use a good laugh.
